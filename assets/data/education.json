The project is guided by a strong supervisory team of more than four specialists (2 from each institutions) from Deakin University and Coventry University. This project is about finding relationship between sleep pattern and different health status (healthy or have sleep disorders) using a simpler physiological signal called Hypnogram for assistive diagnostic. Starting from traditional ML and ensemble ML to advanced models such as traditional DL, CNN, RNN, graph neural networks (GNN), are applied to analyse the feasibility of a wearable sleep monitoring system.
